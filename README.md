### Contribution guidelines

Please do not push changes directly to master.

Before beginning a new feature, make appropriate movements on Trello, then create a new branch on the GitHub page.

Then, in your commandline do the following:
1. `git pull` or `git fetch`
2. `git checkout <branch name>`
3. Do `git branch` to confirm you're on the new feature branch, and not master

If you'd like to play around with this, feel free to use the branch `test-branch`.

Then, add your code, and commit (`git commit -m "<commit description>"`) them as you go. Once finished, push (`git push`) them to GitHub, and create a new pull-request on GitHub.
